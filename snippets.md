### rspec conventions
1. Need to require the file './filename.rb'
1. describe block is name of file being tested with a do/end block
1. it block describes the specific test with do/end block
1. call method and store return value to local variable to be used in an expect() call
1. Add in .rspec --format documentation to print out all information in tests
1. Can define new colors in spec_helper.rb to change pass/fail colors

## Arrays
%w() can create string arrays but putting single words, no double quotes, spaces instead of commas to create one
```Ruby
cats = %w(Mario Rucola)
```

## IRB
- use classes created outside IRB by invoking ```require_relative``` and the class name (ex. ```require_relative './lib/customer.rb'```)
